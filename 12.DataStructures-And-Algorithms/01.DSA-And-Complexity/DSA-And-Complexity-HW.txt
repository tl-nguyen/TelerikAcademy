Task 01:
	Answer: The Complexity is 0(n*n)
	Explanation: The outter for loop, loops n times. The inner for loop, loops
		n times too, because the start variable increase or the end variable
		decrease at every loop until the condition is not true

----------------------
Task 02:
	Answer: The Complexity is 0(n*m) if all the cell can be divided to 2
		The Complexity is 0(n) if all the cell can't be divided to 2
		The Average Complexity is 0(n*m/2)
	Explanation: The outter for loop, loops n times. The Inner If defines if
		The inner for loop will interact or not. The inner for loop, loops
		m times

---------------------
Task 03:
	Answer: The Complexity is 0(n*m)
	Explanation: Implementing the nested loops using recursive method, Everytime
		the method is called, the sum of the cells in the next row is going to 
		be calculated
